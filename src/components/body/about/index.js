          My name is Samuel Heal, a Full-Stack web developer who has recently
          earned a certificate in this field for the completion of the Coding
          Bootcamp hosted by Trilogy Education and the University of Sydney.
          Here, I have learnt the necessary skills required to become a
          competent Full-Stack Web Developer. I am a coding fanatic who is
          constantly seeking new ways to grow and thrive within this industry. I
          place my focus on building projects that I believe can make peopleâ€™s
          lives even slightly easier. My latest project, aDevelopersFriend, is
          designed for web developers in need of a place to easily store their
          code. Built using the MERN framework, It is capable of creating
          projects that can store the folders, front-end files and back-end
          files that allow users to replicate entire project file structures if
          they need. Check it out in my projects section below!
